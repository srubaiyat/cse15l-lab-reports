In this week's lab, we installed Visual Studio Code, remotely connected to the lab computers in the CSE Basement, and tried some commands.

I already had VSCode, but the way to install it is to go to https://code.visualstudio.com/.

Clicking the blue button which preselects the version downloadable for your device should automatically install it in a few minutes. After installing, you should be able to open a window that looks like this:

I started off lab by setting up remote connection. First, I opened up the terminal, and typed in "ssh cs15lwi23adv@ieng6.ucsd.edu". It prompted me for my password, so I typed it in.

Now that I was logged into the remote server, I tried out some commands.
